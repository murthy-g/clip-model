The technology that can generate or retrieve images based on textual descriptions. This is often referred to as "text-to-image synthesis" or "image generation from text." There are several AI algorithms and models that have been developed for this purpose.  here are a few notable approaches:

1.	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a popular class of models for image generation. One specific variant is the "Conditional GAN" or "cGAN," which can take textual descriptions as conditional input to generate corresponding images. By training the generator and discriminator networks in a game-theoretic manner, GANs have shown promising results in generating images from text.
2.	AttnGAN: Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (AttnGAN) is a model that incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the text during image generation. This allows the model to generate images with fine-grained details that match the textual descriptions more effectively.
3.	StackGAN: StackGAN is a two-stage GAN model that generates images in a stepwise manner. The first stage generates a low-resolution image from the text description, and the second stage refines this image to a higher resolution, producing more detailed results.
4.	CLIP: CLIP is a model that learns to understand images and text jointly. It's a vision-language model that can be used for various tasks, including text-to-image synthesis. By embedding both images and texts into a common space, CLIP enables finding the most relevant images for a given textual description.
5.	DALL-E: DALL-E is a variant of the GPT-3 model designed specifically for generating images from textual prompts. It can create novel images based on a wide range of textual descriptions, demonstrating the potential of language models for image synthesis.
6.	VQ-VAE-2: While not directly for text-to-image synthesis, the VQ-VAE-2 model is capable of generating images from discrete codes. This could be used in combination with text embeddings to create images that match a given textual description.
It's important to note that the field of AI evolves rapidly, and there might be newer algorithms or models developed since my last update. When implementing such systems, you'll need to gather a dataset of text-image pairs for training and choose an appropriate algorithm based on your requirements.
Keep in mind that generating high-quality images from text descriptions is still a challenging task, and the results can vary. Additionally, always ensure that you have the necessary rights and permissions for the images you generate or retrieve, as many images are subject to copyright restrictions.
